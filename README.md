# Javascript

This project is my very first attempt to get my hands dirty with Javascript. The project would start from very basic Javascript and would hopefully extend by including a couple of frameworks, i.e. Vue.Js.

## Comments

There are different ways comments can be added in Javascript files.

1. Single line: It starts with `//`.
2. Block comment: starts with `/*` and ends with `*/`. It is usually used at the top of the file or for defining a function.
