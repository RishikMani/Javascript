# Javascript

This project is my very first attempt to get my hands dirty with Javascript. The project would start from very basic Javascript and would hopefully extend by including a couple of frameworks, i.e. Vue.Js.

## Comments

There are different ways comments can be added in Javascript files.

1. Single line: It starts with `//`.
2. Block comment: starts with `/*` and ends with `*/`. It is usually used at the top of the file or for defining a function.

## Variables

One can use `let` to create a variable. Javascript developers no longer prefer declaring variables using the keyword `var`. The convention for choosing the name of variables is to follow camelCase.

```javascript
let var = 10;
```

As opposed to `let`, one can also use `const` to create a variable. The only difference between `let` and `const` is that a variable declared using `const` cannot have a different value assigned to it or in other words, `const` variable value remains constant and can not be changed. A `const` variable should be named using UPPER_SNAKE_CASE.

```javascript
const THRESHOLD = 5.75;
```
