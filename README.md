# Javascript

This project is a very first attempt to get my hands dirty with Javascript. The project would start from very basic Javascript and would hopefully extend by including a couple of frameworks, i.e. Vue.Js. For learning purpose, the whole project would be divided into many different folders covering small concepts.

A lot of very basic stuff is not included as it is almost similar in many other programming languages. I have tried to include concepts which might not be entirely different from similar concepts in other programming languages, but might have a different look and feel attached to them.

**Need to do a lot more reading on promises. The topic seems kind of crazy maze.**

This officially marks part 1 of this Javascript. After this I will move onto other advanced concepts related to Javascripts. But before I moved I have to restructure this huge of `README` file into smaller manageable folders.
